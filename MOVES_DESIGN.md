# Moves design backlog: status effects + non-combat/environmental moves

A dedicated home for the move-system brainstorm so it doesn't get lost in
DESIGN.md (which documents what's actually built and verified) or
TODO.md (short tracked items). Nothing in this file is built yet. When a
piece of this gets built and verified with a real run, its writeup moves
to DESIGN.md and the corresponding TODO.md item gets checked off — this
file is the backlog it comes from, not a replacement for either.

**Not in scope here**: anything weather-flavored (Rain Dance, Sandstorm as
a global effect, weather-gated healing/damage). A separate effort is
building dynamic weather — deliberately not overdesigning that surface
here to avoid stepping on it. A couple of ideas below (Sandstorm as a
*local* hazard, not a weather state) are noted as deferred/reframed for
the same reason.

## Why status effects and environmental moves are two different systems

A damaging move's status chance is a side effect of an existing "attack
this specific enemy" action. An environmental move (Sunny Day,
Dig-to-escape, Growth) doesn't target an enemy at all — it targets a
tile, the caster itself, or nothing in particular. They need different
trigger paths, not one unified "use a move" abstraction:

- **Status effects** ride inside the existing hit-resolution pipeline in
  `predation.ts`'s `resolveHit` — no new targeting logic.
- **Idle/opportunistic utility** (Sunny Day, Growth, self-buffs) needs a
  new check during an otherwise-idle tick, the same architectural slot
  `applyExploration` occupies in needs.ts.
- **Reactive utility** (Dig-to-escape, Leech Seed mid-hunt) hooks into
  `predation.ts`'s existing flee/hunt branches as an alternative to the
  default step-away/attack action.

## Status effects

**Data model.** `Agent.status?: { kind: StatusKind; ticksRemaining?:
number }`, where `StatusKind` is `"burn" | "poison" | "paralysis" |
"sleep" | "freeze"`. Mainline-real invariant: an agent carries at most one
major status at a time. `ticksRemaining` only matters for sleep/freeze
(bounded duration); burn/poison/paralysis persist until their own clear
condition (see below) — no item/ability system exists in this sim to cure
them early.

**Which move causes which status** needs hand-curation, the same way
`EGG_GROUPS_BY_BASE_KEY` was: the *generated* move dex only captured that
a move has a `"StatusEffectAttr"` tag, not which status it inflicts (that
argument lived in a PokeRogue constructor call the importer didn't
parse). So `MoveSpec` gains one more optional field, `statusKind?:
StatusKind`, set by hand only on the curated roster in
`packages/data/src/moves.ts` — e.g. `ember`/`flamethrower` → `"burn"`.
Round out real coverage with one or two more real inflicters (Thunder
Wave → `"paralysis"`, Poison Sting → `"poison"`) rather than inventing
anything not backed by the actual dex.

**Application**: in `resolveHit`, right where `maybeGrantHitSkillPoint`
already piggybacks on a landed, damaging hit — if `move.statusChance`
rolls, `defender` has no `status` yet, and `defender.types` don't grant
real mainline immunity for that kind (Fire can't be burned, Electric
can't be paralyzed, Poison/Steel can't be poisoned, Ice can't be frozen —
free, since `defender.types` is already right there), set
`defender.status`. Skip on a hit that was itself the killing blow — no
point statusing a corpse.

**Resolution reuses two patterns that already exist, not new ones:**
- *Damage-over-time* (burn, poison) mirrors `applyHealOverTime` in
  reverse — a fixed fraction of `maxHp` (mainline-scale: 1/16 burn, 1/8
  poison) taken every tick in `tickAgentNeeds` (the always-runs path).
  Burn additionally halves effective Attack for the duration. Status
  damage that brings HP to 0 **faints, it does not kill outright** — same
  fainted/`finishingPool` pipeline `resolveHit` already uses.
- *Skip-the-action-tick* (paralysis, sleep, freeze) is the same shape as
  the existing `if (agent.fainted) return;` / `if (agent.beingCarriedBy)
  return;` early returns already at the top of `tickAgentAction` — three
  more entries in that list. Paralysis rolls a chance (mainline: 25%) to
  skip on top of a genuine speed cut for the duration, stacking with
  `effectiveSpeed`'s existing injury-based multiplier (support.ts), not
  replacing it. Freeze rolls a per-tick thaw chance (mainline: ~20%); a
  Fire-type hit connecting while frozen thaws it instantly. Sleep gets a
  random bounded duration decided at onset — needs its own tuned
  `SLEEP_TICKS_MIN/MAX` (this sim's ticks are finer-grained than mainline
  turns, so a literal "1-3 turns" doesn't transfer directly).
- **Decided directly, not left open**: burn/poison have no separate
  duration or cure — they deal damage every tick until the DOT itself
  causes a faint, exactly like getting hit does. `defender.status` clears
  the instant it faints, same tick, and ordinary recovery
  (`applyHealOverTime`/`maybeRecoverFromFaint` in support.ts) takes over
  from there with zero new code. Mechanically identical to how a normal
  attack already works — burn/poison are just "damage that lands on its
  own every tick instead of only when someone's swinging at you."

**New events**: `statusInflicted` (kind, agentId, species, inflictedBy)
and `statusCleared` (kind, agentId, reason: `"woke" | "thawed" | "died"`
— no `"expired"`/`"healedFully"` needed now that burn/poison have no
independent duration).

## Environmental utility moves

A hand-curated `ENVIRONMENTAL_EFFECT_BY_MOVE` table (packages/data, same
pattern as the status one) maps real moves to effects. First batch, in
recommended build order (cheapest/safest first — each reuses something
that already exists):

| Move (real) | Effect | What it touches |
|---|---|---|
| Sunny Day | Plants a temporary `sunbeam` tile at the caster's position | flora.ts's `isNearSunbeam`/`FOOD_CHANCE_NEAR_SUNBEAM` — zero new terrain code |
| Dig | Instantly crosses the user to the layer below, at the same (x,y) | Reuses the existing cross-layer mechanic (needs.ts) as an emergency escape |
| Leech Seed | Transfers a fixed amount of hunger/thirst from target to caster | Direct `Needs` field manipulation — the one genuinely new mechanic (resource transfer between two agents) |
| Growth | Force-matures a nearby `seedling` early, or shortens its `MATURATION_TICKS` | Direct hook into flora.ts's existing growth timer |
| Water Gun | Converts an adjacent dry `floor` tile into a temporary puddle | New but minimal — a short-lived stock-bearing water tile |
| Ember (opportunistic, not on-hit) | Burns an adjacent `flora`/`food` tile back to `floor` | Real terraforming, double-edged (clears a blocker, destroys a resource) |

### Round two

| Move (real) | Effect | What it touches |
|---|---|---|
| Acid / Sludge | Contaminates a `food`/`water` tile — can't safely feed there for a while | Inverts Water Gun (deny a resource instead of create one). **Refined per feedback**: the terrain-kill (a flora tile actually dying) is real and permanent; the "unsafe to feed" flag should decay faster the closer a real `water` source is nearby (reuse `findNearestTerrain(world, layer, pos, "water")` to gate the decay rate) rather than a flat timer — flowing water dilutes it, stagnant ground doesn't |
| Growl | AoE Attack debuff on everyone in range who isn't a herd-mate (`herdId` check, same "ally" definition `countHerdAllies` already uses) | **The best ROI move on this whole list** — Bulbasaur, Pidgey, Diglett, Spearow, and Sandshrew all already know Growl at level 1 (it's sitting inert in `knownMoves` right now). Building this one move retroactively activates something most of the current roster already "knows" |
| Leer | Ranged to anything in the user's actual FOV, not a flat radius | **The first real consumer of `computeVisible`** (fov.ts) — that function is fully built and unit-tested but currently used by nothing; every existing detection check (flee/hunt/mob/guardian) is a manhattan-distance radius that sees through walls. Leer would be the first move-driven behavior to actually respect line-of-sight |
| Spikes / Stealth Rock | Lays a persistent hazard on a tile, chips whoever crosses it | New territory — a laid, standing hazard rather than an instant effect. Gives Diglett/Onix a defensive tool with no cost to the caster after laying it |
| Rapid Spin | Clears a hazard tile the user is standing on | Pairs with the above — prey gets a counter to a trap-laying predator's territory |
| Stockpile | Buries a food reserve at the current tile, retrievable later | Real animal behavior (caching), currently totally unmodeled. Plugs into the existing herd food delivery system as another deliverable source |
| Aromatherapy / Heal Bell | Cures status on nearby herd-mates | Real counterplay to burn/poison once those exist; gives grass-types a "medic" role |
| Safeguard | Grants temporary status immunity to nearby herd-mates | A second, distinct guardian-flavored move for Venusaur alongside pure combat intervention |
| Synthesis / Morning Sun | Self-heal, stronger near a `sunbeam` tile | Direct reuse of `isNearSunbeam`, mainline-real weather-scaled-healing mechanic reframed as terrain-scaled |
| Teleport | Instant panic-button relocation | Reuses `findRandomWalkableTile`/`migrate` (migration.ts), already built for a predator giving up on an area |
| Fly | Instant escape to the layer above, mirroring Dig going down | Canopy-native equivalent for Pidgey/Spearow |
| Agility | Temporary speed boost | Hooks directly into the existing `actionEnergy`/`effectiveSpeed` action-economy system — acts more often for a while |
| Follow Me / Rage Powder | Guardian redirects a predator's target onto itself instead of the weakest nearby herd-mate | The strongest upgrade to Venusaur's guardian role on this list — actively rewrites `predation.ts`'s target selection instead of just reacting after the fact |
| Helping Hand | Buffs the next hit a nearby ally lands | Real mob-fight coordination flavor on top of the coordination logic already built |
| Confuse Ray / Supersonic | A genuine second tier beyond the 5 majors — mainline models confusion as a separate "volatile" status that can stack with a major one | For its duration, the agent's own move sometimes misfires and hits itself. Worth building once the 5-major plumbing exists, not before |
| Cut | Precise, non-destructive clear of exactly one blocking `flora` tile | Low-stakes version of Ember's terraform — no risk of torching a food supply |
| Bulldoze / Magnitude | Area version of Rock Throw's wall-cracking — multiple adjacent `wall` tiles at once | Rounds out the terraforming set |

### Round three

| Move (real) | Effect | What it touches |
|---|---|---|
| Camouflage | Shrinks how far away *others* can detect the caster | Inverse of Growl's noise-making — first real building block toward a detection-radius system (see below) |
| Withdraw / Harden | Doubles as "go still and quiet," on top of being a defense buff | Same flavor as Camouflage, real mainline moves |
| Rock Slide from high ground | Only works, or hits much harder, when the caster occupies higher elevation than the target | The scenario's own ridge is *already* described as "high ground the Venusaur guardians hold" (scenario.ts) — this move is the thing that terrain feature was built for, currently only a cosmetic-plus-combat-modifier |
| Odor Sleuth | Keeps a specific fled/hidden target locatable for a duration regardless of normal detection range | Real counterplay to Camouflage |
| Explosion / Self-Destruct | Massive area damage, faints the user | The aggressive twin to Memento — a cornered prey animal taking its predator down with it |
| Memento | User faints itself, grants a big stat/exp boost to nearby herd-mates | Real "tell an interesting story" material — an aging guardian's last act, now that old-age mortality exists as a system this can tie into |
| Wish | Plants a delayed heal that lands on whichever herd-mate occupies this tile next, not the caster | A little first-aid kit left behind |
| Rototiller | AoE version of Growth — boosts germination odds for every nearby seedling at once | "Tilling the soil" flavor for Ground/Grass types |
| Attract | Directly spikes a *specific* target's `mateDrive` toward the caster | Asymmetric to Sweet Scent (which widens the caster's own search radius) — "you, specifically, want me" instead of "I'm more findable" |
| Baby-Doll Eyes / Charm | Temporarily lowers a target's aggression | Softens how eager a predator is to commit to hunting the caster |

**Passive idea, not a move at all**: a corpse that survives its full
`CORPSE_PERSIST_TICKS` window before decaying could bump germination odds
on the tile it's on when it's finally pruned — decomposition enriching
soil, real ecology, zero new move needed, just a tweak to corpse pruning.

### Round four — HMs, and the real finding underneath them

Prompted by naming Whirlpool/Flash/Will-o-Wisp directly: HMs are the
actual real-game precedent for "a non-combat move that changes the map,"
which is exactly what this whole brainstorm has been reaching for.

| Move (real) | Effect | What it touches |
|---|---|---|
| Flash | **Dual effect, both real mainline**: expands the caster's own FOV radius (a defensive use of `computeVisible`, the mirror image of Leer's offensive one) *and* lowers a target's accuracy in combat | Confirmed: both halves stay in, not just the FOV one |
| Surf | Temporarily treats `water` tiles as walkable for the caster | Needs a Water-type to make any sense — see the roster gap below |
| Whirlpool | Field: crosses deep water. Battle: a multi-turn bind, same family as String Shot/Sand Tomb | Needs Water |
| Waterfall | Instantly scales a steep `elevation` delta that would otherwise slow/block movement | Direct reuse of `elevation.ts`'s existing delta math, inverted from "combat modifier" to "movement enabler" |
| Strength | Pushes a boulder — a `wall` tile becomes permanently passable rubble | Distinct from Rock Smash/Bulldoze: those are combat-triggered instant clears, this is a deliberate, permanent, non-combat map edit |
| Rock Smash | Single-tile version of Bulldoze/Magnitude from round two | Same slot, smaller footprint |
| Will-o-Wisp | Pure status move — little/no direct damage, very high burn chance | A genuinely different design point from Ember (damaging move with a status side effect): a move whose entire job is inflicting the condition. Doesn't strictly need a Ghost-type learner |

**The real finding underneath this round**: the current roster (Grass/
Poison, Fire, Bug/Flying, Normal/Flying, Ground, Rock) has **zero**
representation for Water, Electric, Ghost, Ice, Psychic, Dark, Steel,
Fairy, or Dragon. Most of the moves above are inert without a species of
the right type to learn them — same shape as the Spearow/Onix expansion
earlier, where two new species unlocked the underground/canopy layers for
free. **Confirmed for real addition** (not just brainstormed — explicitly
approved): a short list of real, well-known, early-game candidates, each
chosen because it unlocks a cluster of the moves above at once rather
than just one:

- **Water** (Squirtle, Poliwag, or Magikarp) — unlocks Surf/Whirlpool/
  Waterfall/Water Gun (round one) all at once, and finally gives the
  ponds already sitting on the map a resident.
- **Electric** (Pikachu, Magnemite) — unlocks Thunder Wave (paralysis,
  already in the status design) plus Discharge (AoE paralysis chance) and
  Magnet Rise (temporary immunity to ground-based hazards like Spikes).
- **Psychic** (Abra, Drowzee) — Hypnosis is Will-o-Wisp's sleep-status
  equivalent (pure status, no damage); Psychic is also the *actual*
  canonical type for Teleport (round two filed it under Ground/generic).
- **Ghost or Dark** (a real home for Will-o-Wisp, or Taunt — forces a
  target into aggressive-only behavior for a duration, overriding its
  normal flee/idle logic, a nasty and funny debuff).

Build order for the species themselves: Water first (existing pond
infrastructure means it needs zero new terrain, just a new resident —
same reasoning that put Sunny Day/Growl at the top of the move list).

**Water: shipped.** Squirtle added — see DESIGN.md's "First Water-type"
section for the real-run evidence (cross-species breeding with the
Bulbasaur/Venusaur line via the shared Monster egg group, an opportunistic
Spearow kill with zero new predation code, evolution to Wartortle at
level 16). Surf/Whirlpool/Waterfall/Water Gun above are now buildable
against a real species; Water Gun itself is already curated. Electric/
Psychic/Ghost-or-Dark are next, in that order.

**Declined**: Bug Bite / Pluck (priority looting rights on a corpse) —
explicitly cut per feedback, not worth the complexity for what it adds.

## The detection-radius gap (a real, structural finding, not a move)

Surfaced while designing Leer: there is currently **no concept of
detection at all** beyond "is it within N tiles." No fog of war, no
line-of-sight gating (FOV is fully built in fov.ts and unit-tested, but
nothing in the actual AI — flee, hunt, mob, guardian scans — consults it;
every one is a flat manhattan-distance radius that sees straight through
walls), no sound, no scent. Every agent has perfect knowledge of every
other agent within its fixed radius.

Not building this now — flagged so it doesn't get lost. When it happens,
the natural shape is a "how did this agent learn about that agent"
abstraction that flee/hunt/mob/guardian checks route through instead of a
raw radius, with real line-of-sight (reusing `computeVisible`) as the
baseline and sound/scent as radius modifiers on top (a noise-making move
like Growl would set a temporary "detectable beyond normal range" flag;
Camouflage would do the opposite). Leer (round two, above) is the
smallest possible first step — a single move that actually respects FOV —
without committing to the whole system.

## Confirmed for later: Diglett tunnel networks

**Decision, not just a brainstormed idea — explicitly confirmed
("tunnel networks are cool as fuck we're gonna do it, but just not
now").** Repeated Dig usage at two different underground points links
them as a fast-travel shortcut, letting Diglett/Dugtrio traverse the
underground layer unusually fast between marked points. Deliberately not
scoped or speced further here: it reads as map-connectivity/
infrastructure, which sits close enough to the migration/biome work
happening in parallel that it should wait until that lands, both to avoid
overlap and because tunnel shortcuts probably want to interact with
whatever "biome" boundaries that work introduces. Revisit once migration/
biomes ship.

## Build order recommendation, across everything above

1. **Growl** — highest payoff-to-effort ratio on this entire list; most
   of the roster already knows it.
2. **Sunny Day** — purely additive, cannot make anything worse, visible
   in a replay immediately.
3. **Leer** — first real FOV consumer; proves out line-of-sight-gated
   targeting as a pattern other moves (and eventually detection in
   general) can reuse.
4. **Dig-to-escape** — meaningfully changes prey survival odds, easy to
   verify with a before/after real-run comparison.
5. Burn/poison (the DOT half of status effects) — reuses
   `applyHealOverTime`'s shape almost exactly, and unlocks Aromatherapy/
   Safeguard's counterplay once it exists.
6. Everything else, roughly in the order listed above within each round.
