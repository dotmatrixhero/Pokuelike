# TODO / Side Notes

Running list of ideas and decisions to revisit — not a sprint plan, just a
place to park trains of thought so they don't get lost.

## Priority: sim depth + observability (current focus)

Per DESIGN.md's north star — the sim needs to be able to run headless and
produce a real story before player mechanics are worth building further.

- [x] Headless sim runner (`packages/runner`, `pnpm run run [ticks]`) that
      ticks the world N times and prints the event log — no renderer, no
      player.
- [x] Event log with semantic content (`packages/engine/src/events.ts`):
      `crossedLayer`, `consumed`, `behaviorChanged`. Still missing the
      bigger ones — births, deaths, herd relocations, predation — since
      those behaviors don't exist yet either (see Ecosystem sim below).
- [x] Ran it (300 ticks, see DESIGN.md) — it did surface a real, specific
      finding (Diglett stops going home after ~tick 70), which counts as
      passing the "worth telling" bar even though it's a tuning gap, not a
      dramatic story yet.
- [x] Predation built and run — see "Ecosystem sim" below. First run with
      it produced an actual dramatic story: a Scyther killed 3 of 4
      Bulbasaur in the herd over 300 ticks.
- [ ] Tuning gap found by the first run: an agent whose needs oscillate
      between just-under and just-over the 0.7 satisfied line (flat +0.4
      consume vs. 0.3 idle threshold) can permanently stop returning to
      `homeLayer` because it never registers `idle`. Decide if that's
      acceptable emergent behavior or needs a hysteresis/threshold fix.
- [ ] Tuning gap found by the predation run: fleeing agents flicker between
      `flee` and normal foraging almost every tick in some stretches (the
      4-tile flee-detection radius may be too wide relative to how far one
      flee-step moves an agent out of range). Worth a hysteresis or a
      "stay fled for N ticks after losing the threat" rule.
- [ ] **Real bottleneck found after adding reproduction + flora (see
      DESIGN.md): the predator never leaves.** Herd extinction (0 births,
      dead by tick 217) survived both a flee-radius theory and a food-
      scarcity theory — confirmed cause is `flee` unconditionally
      preempting `seekMate` every tick, forever, because Scyther has no
      migration/territory/satiation behavior pushing it to leave the
      herd's range after a kill. This is the next thing to build, and
      it's predator-side, not prey-side: something like a satiation-driven
      wander/range mechanic so a fed predator moves on and prey get a
      window. Try this before touching flee-radius or mate-priority
      numbers again — two tuning guesses have already been wrong.
- [x] Predator-side fix built: mob-fighting, risk-aware hunting, and
      relocate-after-repeated-failure (see DESIGN.md). Unit-tests confirm
      the mechanism works (a synchronized mob of 3 can defeat a predator).
      Real 1000-tick run still ended in full extinction, but for a new and
      more specific reason — see next item. Progress, not a fix yet.
- [ ] **Coordination gap found by the mob-fighting run**: `mobSize` counts
      how many herd-mates are *somewhere* within the muster radius (4
      tiles), not how many are actually adjacent and fighting yet. A lone
      Bulbasaur that reaches the predator first commits to `fight` alone
      because the headcount check passes on the herd's total nearby
      population, dies immediately (predator's kill-on-contact isn't
      interruptible by simultaneous damage), and its real backup — still
      mid-flee-cycle several tiles away — never arrives in time. Fix
      target: require some number of allies to *also* be within striking
      distance (not just the muster radius) before anyone commits to
      fighting solo, so mobbing only happens when the group has actually
      converged. Try this before adding anything else predator-side —
      three tuning guesses in now, worth actually confirming this one
      before moving on.

## World layers, elevation, and regions (see DESIGN.md)
- [x] `Tile`/`World` have a `layer` dimension (Underground/Surface/Canopy,
      shared x,y footprint) — agents native to one layer, movement mostly
      stays within it.
- [x] Cross-layer behavior is common: species whose resources (food/water)
      live on a different layer than their home layer routinely cross
      (Diglett surfacing, Pidgey landing) as part of normal need-seeking —
      see `findLayerWithTerrain`/`tickAgent` in `packages/engine/src/needs.ts`.
- [x] Elevation: continuous heightmap on Surface tiles, elevation-aware FOV
      (`fov.ts`) and elevation-delta combat modifiers (`elevation.ts`, not
      yet consumed by any combat resolver since one doesn't exist yet).
      Open: whether Underground/Canopy get their own elevation too.
- [ ] World graph of 3–5 regions connected by migration edges, each
      independently bounded.
- [ ] Region-level promotion/demotion: observed region runs full per-agent
      sim across all layers; unobserved region runs abstracted (aggregate
      counts/needs/resources per species, occasional emitted events).
      Symmetric with the existing agent-level promotion boundary concept.
- [ ] Open: how aggregate-region state reconciles back into individual
      agents on promotion — invented plausible agents, or something lossy
      that's fine for background regions but worth being honest about.

## Ecosystem sim
- [ ] Herd cohesion: agents share `herdId` in the type but nothing groups or
      regroups them yet. Flocking forces? A shared "home range" center each
      herd member biases toward? — still open, unrelated to predation below.
- [x] `seekMate`/reproduction built (`packages/engine/src/reproduction.ts`)
      — mature, opposite-sex, same-species/layer/herd agents pair up and
      produce offspring on contact. See DESIGN.md for why it produced zero
      births in the current demo world (predator-pressure bottleneck, not
      a reproduction-system bug).
- [x] `hunt`/`flee` are built (`packages/engine/src/predation.ts`,
      `HuntRules`, `SpeciesDef.preysOn` in `packages/data`) — a nearby
      predator triggers flee (overrides everything), a hungry predator with
      prey in range hunts and kills on contact. Currently just Scyther ->
      Bulbasaur.
- [x] Mob-fighting, predator risk-assessment, and relocate built on top of
      the above — see DESIGN.md's "Mob-fighting" section and the
      coordination-gap item above for the real (not yet fully successful)
      result.
- [x] Resource depletion + regrowth + seed-spread built
      (`packages/engine/src/flora.ts`) — food tiles have a depletable/
      regrowing `stock`, agents occasionally seed new patches as they move,
      a slow seasonal cycle modulates regrowth rate. Confirmed working
      (seeds sprout on schedule) but didn't fix the extinction problem —
      see the bottleneck note above. Water is still infinite/undepletable
      (a lake doesn't run dry at this scale) — food/berries only, per the
      original ask.
- [ ] Egg stage instead of instant offspring, with parental guarding
      behavior — confirmed canon-real and mechanically rich (Seaking pairs
      guard eggs for a month+, "defends with its life," per research done
      this session). A guarded, vulnerable incubation period is better
      story material than an instant birth. Deliberately deferred rather
      than built alongside plain reproduction, to keep that slice small.
- [ ] Herd cohesion: agents share `herdId` in the type but nothing groups or
      regroups them yet. Flocking forces? A shared "home range" center each
      herd member biases toward? — still open, unrelated to predation.
- [ ] Performance ceiling for the cheap tier — how many agents before naive
      per-tick nearest-tile search (`findNearestTerrain` is O(width*height)
      per agent!) needs spatial indexing? Also now true of `growFlora`'s
      full-grid scan every tick.

## Culture, disposition, and roles (pitched, not built — see chat)
- [ ] Disposition vector per individual (boldness/aggression/sociability at
      minimum) driving AI decisions, distinct from canon Nature (stat bias
      only). Herd "culture" (fight-or-flee threshold, etc.) should be a
      computed aggregate of member dispositions weighted by role/rank, not
      a stored per-herd flag — same shape as the region-level promotion-
      boundary aggregate, one level down.
- [ ] Role field (`leader | guardian | member`) held by individuals, not
      species — "two Venusaur guard this herd" is two agents holding a
      role, contested and reassigned over time (e.g. on a guardian's
      death), not a species-level fact.
- [ ] Evolution as a dispersal trigger: a Disposition-weighted chance to
      leave the herd and seek a mate elsewhere on evolving — real biology
      (natal dispersal/inbreeding avoidance), and the concrete reason the
      world-graph/region-migration idea above would actually get used.
- [ ] Pair-bonding as a disposition trait (`monogamous | opportunistic`,
      or a continuous "fidelity" score): a monogamous agent that
      successfully mates records a `mateId` and prefers/restricts to that
      partner afterward; losing a bonded mate could mean never re-bonding
      (permanent, DF-style) or a grief cooldown. This is what makes
      individuals distinguishable by story ("bonded at tick 40, widowed at
      137, never mated again") rather than every agent of a species having
      the same behavior. Needs individuals to actually survive long enough
      to mate first — see the predator-pressure bottleneck above.
- [ ] Individual stats/moveset/level per agent (not just species-level
      moves) — ties into the still-undesigned combat resolver/promotion
      boundary, not started.

## Player / bonding (deprioritized until sim depth lands)
- [ ] Threat signature model — what exactly feeds it (speed/distance/posture)
      and how it plugs into existing perception/behavior logic.
- [ ] Concrete verbs for each trust-stage transition, per species — this is
      still just shaped, not designed as actual player inputs.
- [ ] Whether species-specific bonding puzzles read as distinct to a player
      without a tutorial — open playtesting question, see DESIGN.md.
- [ ] World-state consequences of a botched approach (herd relocation,
      species-wide wariness) — needs the resource-depletion/migration sim
      work above to exist first.

## Combat / moves
- [ ] The "promotion boundary" transition itself (see DESIGN.md) — not
      designed yet, just named.
- [ ] Move leveling/respec system — how builds are earned, spent, reverted.
- [ ] Status effects (burn, etc.) — `burnChance` exists in move tuning data
      but nothing consumes it.
- [ ] Turn-based vs. real-time-with-pause for combat — undecided.
- [ ] Facing/direction for the player during combat — how is it chosen?

## Art / assets
- [ ] Sprite pipeline is bring-your-own (`packages/web/public/sprites/`) —
      decide on sprite sheet format/size once real art exists.
- [ ] Tile art vs. the current flat-color terrain rendering.

## Infra
- [ ] No lint/format config yet (eslint/prettier) — add once the codebase
      is bigger than "does it typecheck."
- [ ] No CI yet.
