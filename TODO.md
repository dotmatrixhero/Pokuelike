# TODO / Side Notes

Running list of ideas and decisions to revisit — not a sprint plan, just a
place to park trains of thought so they don't get lost.

## Priority: sim depth + observability (current focus)

Per DESIGN.md's north star — the sim needs to be able to run headless and
produce a real story before player mechanics are worth building further.

- [x] Headless sim runner (`packages/runner`, `pnpm run run [ticks]`) that
      ticks the world N times and prints the event log — no renderer, no
      player.
- [x] Event log with semantic content (`packages/engine/src/events.ts`):
      `crossedLayer`, `consumed`, `behaviorChanged`. Still missing the
      bigger ones — births, deaths, herd relocations, predation — since
      those behaviors don't exist yet either (see Ecosystem sim below).
- [x] Ran it (300 ticks, see DESIGN.md) — it did surface a real, specific
      finding (Diglett stops going home after ~tick 70), which counts as
      passing the "worth telling" bar even though it's a tuning gap, not a
      dramatic story yet. The dramatic stories need predation/death, which
      aren't built.
- [ ] Tuning gap found by the first run: an agent whose needs oscillate
      between just-under and just-over the 0.7 satisfied line (flat +0.4
      consume vs. 0.3 idle threshold) can permanently stop returning to
      `homeLayer` because it never registers `idle`. Decide if that's
      acceptable emergent behavior or needs a hysteresis/threshold fix.

## World layers, elevation, and regions (see DESIGN.md)
- [x] `Tile`/`World` have a `layer` dimension (Underground/Surface/Canopy,
      shared x,y footprint) — agents native to one layer, movement mostly
      stays within it.
- [x] Cross-layer behavior is common: species whose resources (food/water)
      live on a different layer than their home layer routinely cross
      (Diglett surfacing, Pidgey landing) as part of normal need-seeking —
      see `findLayerWithTerrain`/`tickAgent` in `packages/engine/src/needs.ts`.
- [x] Elevation: continuous heightmap on Surface tiles, elevation-aware FOV
      (`fov.ts`) and elevation-delta combat modifiers (`elevation.ts`, not
      yet consumed by any combat resolver since one doesn't exist yet).
      Open: whether Underground/Canopy get their own elevation too.
- [ ] World graph of 3–5 regions connected by migration edges, each
      independently bounded.
- [ ] Region-level promotion/demotion: observed region runs full per-agent
      sim across all layers; unobserved region runs abstracted (aggregate
      counts/needs/resources per species, occasional emitted events).
      Symmetric with the existing agent-level promotion boundary concept.
- [ ] Open: how aggregate-region state reconciles back into individual
      agents on promotion — invented plausible agents, or something lossy
      that's fine for background regions but worth being honest about.

## Ecosystem sim
- [ ] Herd cohesion: agents share `herdId` in the type but nothing groups or
      regroups them yet. Flocking forces? A shared "home range" center each
      herd member biases toward?
- [ ] `seekMate` / mating behavior not implemented — what does a "mating"
      outcome even do (spawn a new agent? just a behavior with no mechanical
      effect yet)?
- [ ] `hunt` / `flee` behaviors named but unimplemented — predator/prey
      relationships need a data source (which species hunt which).
- [ ] Resource depletion — water/food tiles are infinite right now. Real DF
      feel probably wants them to deplete and regenerate, driving migration.
- [ ] Performance ceiling for the cheap tier — how many agents before naive
      per-tick nearest-tile search (`findNearestTerrain` is O(width*height)
      per agent!) needs spatial indexing?

## Player / bonding (deprioritized until sim depth lands)
- [ ] Threat signature model — what exactly feeds it (speed/distance/posture)
      and how it plugs into existing perception/behavior logic.
- [ ] Concrete verbs for each trust-stage transition, per species — this is
      still just shaped, not designed as actual player inputs.
- [ ] Whether species-specific bonding puzzles read as distinct to a player
      without a tutorial — open playtesting question, see DESIGN.md.
- [ ] World-state consequences of a botched approach (herd relocation,
      species-wide wariness) — needs the resource-depletion/migration sim
      work above to exist first.

## Combat / moves
- [ ] The "promotion boundary" transition itself (see DESIGN.md) — not
      designed yet, just named.
- [ ] Move leveling/respec system — how builds are earned, spent, reverted.
- [ ] Status effects (burn, etc.) — `burnChance` exists in move tuning data
      but nothing consumes it.
- [ ] Turn-based vs. real-time-with-pause for combat — undecided.
- [ ] Facing/direction for the player during combat — how is it chosen?

## Art / assets
- [ ] Sprite pipeline is bring-your-own (`packages/web/public/sprites/`) —
      decide on sprite sheet format/size once real art exists.
- [ ] Tile art vs. the current flat-color terrain rendering.

## Infra
- [ ] No lint/format config yet (eslint/prettier) — add once the codebase
      is bigger than "does it typecheck."
- [ ] No CI yet.
