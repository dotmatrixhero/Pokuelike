Plan:

In tile interprett im going to add the color map that will translate all the color strings into real tcod colors.
then it will pass all those colors diectly into whatever.

I'm tryin to figure out what is wrong with using pointers. For some reason, I can't return null.

The most important thing is to figure out how to make the player an actor. And in Drawables put in a print function to the
root console so that I can call print easily.

take out the magic map numbers 78, 55 (it should be 45 anyways)
